HN
What is HN? HN stands for: HyperNull , and in "Layman's Terms", buffs your Events and/or Signals.
NOTES: This won't work on LC edits. Yes, LC is that janky. This also applies to all IL and Ascensionist edits. Actually, scrap this. This will not function in most CR scripts, such as the ones crossed out.

Option 1 to use HN:
The Manual Way
Step 1
Upload a MainModule to Roblox with this code inside and nothing else:
return function()
    local _hypf = Instance.new("BindableFunction")
    local _defr = function(...)
        pcall(task.defer, ...) 
    end
    local Root = {}    
    
    Root.HN = function(f, ...)
        _hypf.OnInvoke = function(...) 
            if pcall(_hypf.Invoke, _hypf, ...) == false then 
                f() 
            end 
        end
        if pcall(_hypf.Invoke, _hypf, ...) == false then 
            f()
            return end
    end
    
    Root.SN = function(i, f, ...)
        local p = 0
        local m = i
        local w
        w = function(...) p += 1 
            if p == i then 
                f() 
            end 
            if p == i then 
                return end 
            _defr(w, ...) 
        end
        _defr(w, ...)
    end
    
    return Root
end

Step 2
Call this MainModule at the start of your script, with the variable hn.
Example: local hn = require(yourid)
Step 3
Before creating a event (such as heartbeat):
hn.HN(function()

and end your event with a extra:
end)

Step 4
Enjoy all the luxuries of Unlimited Power.

Option 2
Automated way
Alternatively, you may use ezhn (made by ceat_ceat), but it will not be as flexible as it HNifies all of your Events. There are situations where HN is not beneficial to the Event, and so you may want to exclude HN from being applied to it. Additionally, at this time, ezhn is not available.
